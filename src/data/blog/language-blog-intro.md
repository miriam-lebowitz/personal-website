  "INTRO POST: My background with language learning, my perspectives on common language learning practices, and expectations for my blog."

Languages have always fascinated me — not just words themselves, but the cultures, connections, and perspectives that come with them. For example, did you know that very few words can be translated across all languages? Even words like "hand", which in English refers to the appendage at the end of an arm including your palm, fingers, and thumb, isn't the same in all languages. Instead, some languages use a term that refers to your hand, wrist, and sometimes your forearm. Other languages don't have words for individual numbers. Instead, they just use words to represent the concepts of large and small quantities. Put plainly: the words we use and the perspective we have on the world are very closely related. 

In ungrad, I decided to take this interest to the next level, and study Linguistics on top of Computer Science and Psychology. As much as I loved my Linguistics 101 class (and I truly did!), I realized pretty quickly that 3 majors in four years was quite an undertaking. Instead, I decided to consolidate my Psychology and Linguistic majors into a Psycholinguistics major, which basically means I took all the regular Psychology courses offered by my university, and worked as a research assistant in the Language & Cognitive Neuroscience Lab (LCNL) under the supervision of psychology professor Maryellen MacDonald (who published a really [cool and accessible book](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/724046/more-than-words-by-maryellen-macdonald-phd/) about her research) and graduate researcher Elise Hopman. Together, we constructed our own simple language about aliens complete with nouns, verbs, adjectives, and conjugations, and we taught it to undergrads in 90 minute sessions. Some of our research participants were asked to speak aloud while learning the language and some were not. We then analyzed how well students in each group learned our made-up language, and it turns out: SPEAKING OUT LOUD IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR LANGUAGE LEARNING. While I did write and submit a thesis about my research, it was never formally published. (Although, if you're interested in a similar study with a similar language, check out [this research article](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maryellen-Macdonald-2/publication/324470422_Production_Practice_During_Language_Learning_Improves_Comprehension/links/66df2e9efa5e11512cadf501/Production-Practice-During-Language-Learning-Improves-Comprehension.pdf).)

Since graduating in 2022, I've decided to pursue a career in technology (which you can read all about in the [About](/about) tab of this website). To satisfy my interest in language learning, I've decided to choose a language every year to study. Here's what I've attempted so far:

2022: Italian
2023: Levantinian Arabic
2024: ASL
2025: Japanese
2026: Brazilian Portuguese

Note: As a kid, I learned Spanish and Hebrew from school and family, respectively. I also once learned some Dothraki and a Lord of the Rings language for a speech on constructed languages that I competed with in high school.

My approach to language learning has varied from year-to-year depending on how much time I have, what resources I discover, and how motivated I am. I intend to use this blog to document my approaches, both to help other language learners and to remind myself where I left off if I ever decide to revisit a language. Regardless, there are a few things I always consistenly try to include in my learning process:

1. SPEAKING PRACTICE - If it wasn't clear already, speaking is really important to language learning, especially as an adult language learner. I always try to find a way to practice speaking with others, whether that means finding a tutor to practice with or traveling to a country to speak with natives.
2. CULTURE - In addition to practicing the language itself, I try to find ways to learn more about the associated culture(s), too. This can be as simple as following native speakers on social media, listening to music, reading books related to the language, learning about the history of a language, and (ideally) interacting with people who actually use the language.
3. WHY - I always try to clearly identify _why_ I'm learning a language so that I'm motivated to put time into learning it. Sometimes my motivation has been to better understand geopolitics, other times I've wanted to visit a particular country, and sometimes it's because someone important to me speaks a particular language.

With that, let's get to learning!
