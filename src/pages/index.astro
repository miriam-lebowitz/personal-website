      <p>
        I’m a Solutions Architect with over three years of experience helping 
        startups accelerate growth through cost-effective cloud architectures. 
        Working with AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon Bedrock, and 
        Amazon SageMaker, I partner closely with customers to turn ambitious 
        business ideas into real, production-ready applications. 

        <br />
        <br />

        I enjoy working at the intersection of technology and strategy—breaking
        down complex challenges, simplifying architectures, and designing 
        solutions that are practical, efficient, and impactful. My focus is 
        always on enabling teams to move faster, build confidently, and deliver 
        meaningful value to their customers.

        <br />
        <br />

        Outside of cloud architecture, I have a strong interest in languages—both
        spoken and programming—and I enjoy exploring how they shape the way people 
        think, communicate, and solve problems. I’m also an avid reader, always 
        curious to learn something new, whether it’s technology, history, or ideas 
        that challenge my perspective.
